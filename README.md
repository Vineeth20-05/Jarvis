ðŸ“˜ Jarvis â€“ Python Voice Assistant
âœ… About the Project

Jarvis is a voice-controlled personal assistant built using Python. It listens to your commands, opens websites like Google and YouTube, plays music from a predefined library, fetches the latest news, and provides answers using OpenAI's language model.

This project demonstrates how to combine voice recognition, text-to-speech, API integration, and environment variable management in Python.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ” Voice recognition using speech_recognition
âœ” Text-to-speech using pyttsx3
âœ” Open websites (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn)
âœ” Play music from a preset list
âœ” Fetch news headlines using NewsAPI
âœ” Provide AI-powered responses using OpenAI's API
âœ” Secure API keys management using .env file

âš™ Setup Instructions

Clone the repository

git clone your_repo_url
cd your_project_directory


Create and activate the virtual environment

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # For PowerShell


Install required packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


Create a .env file in the project directory and add:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key


Run the assistant

python main.py

ðŸ“‚ File Structure
Jarvis/
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/                # Virtual environment (excluded from GitHub)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                 # Stores your API keys (excluded from GitHub)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore           # To ignore sensitive files
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main script file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # List of Python packages
â”œâ”€â”€ musicLib.py          # Music library links
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # This file

ðŸ“¦ .gitignore

Make sure .venv/ and .env are listed in .gitignore to keep your environment and API keys private.

ðŸ“¢ Usage Notes

Always activate the virtual environment before running the script.

Do not share your .env file as it contains your API keys.

Keep pip updated for best performance.
